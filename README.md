## Dispatch

This project contains a demo messenger for communicating with each other without knowledge of English in English (through a translator), created using Kotlin and Firebase.

The ideology of the project is to improve the level of English by communicating with each other, sending a message in Russian, it is translated into English and saved in both languages.
It is possible to send a message in English (if you know how to write a sentence in English) - it will be translated into Russian and saved in both languages.
Upon receipt, all messages are displayed in English.

## Get started

To get started you need to first create a Firebase project for your app and add the google-service.json file in your project.
After adding the google-services.json file, you need to create a database in Firebase Authentication, Firebase Database, Firebase Storage.
Firebase Authentication needs to allow user registration by email.
